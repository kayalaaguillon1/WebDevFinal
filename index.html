          <h3>The Start Of Revolutionary Cuisine</h3>
          <p>Founded in 1987, the founders of Fortuna believed that one of the most beautiful parts about life are the little unplanned details every day. Because of this, 
            they decided to create Fortuna, the world's first randomized fine dining experience.</p>
            <br>  
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <p>Once arriving, our free of charge valet service will park your car, as long as you have scheduled a reservation. After being seated, you will be able to choose one of our appetizers, as well as beverages. One of our servers will then ask about dietary restrictions, and our world-class chefs will then prepare the unique meal of the day, substituting ingredients when needed on a case-by-case basis.
            It is important to note that ingredients will only be substituted if there are dietary restrictions, not because of personal preferences.*</p>
